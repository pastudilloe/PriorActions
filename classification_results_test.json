    "explanation": "The report primarily focuses on financial sector development and capital markets practices, with a specific emphasis on advisory services and peer group dialogue related to debt markets. While the report does mention global financial crisis and policy challenges faced by bond markets, there is no direct evidence linking it to education, health, or nutrition policies. The excerpt mentioning 'develop instrument support policy reform health system essential improve productive capacity populat...' indicates a slight relevance to the 'Access to quality care' policy area, hence a score of 0.4 is assigned. However, the report lacks substantial evidence to support a strong relation to any specific education, health, or nutrition policy areas.",

The evidence provided in the report mentions the identification of gaps in the Indian statistical system and the initiation of major reforms to address them. This aligns with the policy area of enhancing education quality, as improving the statistical system is crucial for monitoring and improving educational outcomes. However, the report does not directly address improving access to education or fostering labor market transitions, hence the low scores assigned to those policy areas.",
