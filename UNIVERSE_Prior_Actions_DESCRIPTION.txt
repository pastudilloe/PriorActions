Topic 1: Education
Education plays a critical role in human capital formation, enabling individuals to develop skills, increase productivity, and access better economic opportunities. For poor and vulnerable populations, quality education represents one of the most powerful pathways out of poverty. However, structural inequalities in educational access, quality, and relevance can perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit inclusive growth.
 
Policy Area 1.1: Improving access to education
Expanding access to quality education for underserved populations is essential for creating equitable economic opportunities. Policies that reduce barriers to education access—such as eliminating school fees, providing conditional cash transfers, and investing in school infrastructure in marginalized communities—disproportionately benefit the poorest households. These interventions can reduce the opportunity and direct costs of education for vulnerable groups while increasing their enrollment, attendance, and completion rates, enabling them to build essential human capital assets for future economic participation. Early childhood education initiatives have particularly strong distributional impacts, as they establish cognitive and socio-emotional foundations that yield long-term returns in educational achievement and earnings, helping to level the playing field for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
 
Policy Area 1.2: Enhancing education quality
Access to education alone is insufficient if learning outcomes remain poor. Quality improvement policies—including teacher development, curriculum reform, learning assessment systems, and accountability mechanisms—can significantly improve the educational outcomes of disadvantaged students who typically receive lower-quality instruction. These reforms have progressive distributional impacts, as they increase the economic returns to education particularly for poor and vulnerable groups who would otherwise remain trapped in a cycle of schooling without learning, ultimately improving their future productivity and earnings. Learning-focused reforms that prioritize foundational skills acquisition in early grades can be especially beneficial for disadvantaged students, providing them with the core competencies needed for continued educational success and labor market participation despite less supportive learning environments at home.
 
Policy Area 1.3: Fostering labor market transitions
The economic value of education ultimately depends on how well it prepares individuals for productive employment. Policies that strengthen education-to-work transitions—including technical and vocational education, apprenticeship programs, career services, and digital skills development—have a strong equalizing effect for disadvantaged youth who typically lack the social networks and information needed to navigate labor markets. These interventions help level the playing field in employment opportunities, increasing the likelihood that poor and vulnerable populations can convert their educational investments into improved economic outcomes. Labor market information systems and targeted job placement services can further strengthen the distributional benefits by addressing information asymmetries that particularly disadvantage youth from poor backgrounds, connecting them with employment opportunities that offer pathways to economic mobility.
 
 
Topic 2: Health and nutrition
Developing instruments and supporting policy reforms for health systems are essential to improving the productive capacity of populations, addressing structural inequalities in healthcare access, and creating economic opportunities through better health outcomes. Health policy reforms can directly impact poverty reduction by lowering household health expenditures, improving labor productivity, and enabling the poor to accumulate and utilize human capital assets.
 
Policy Area 2.1: Access to quality care
Health systems strengthening reforms address the foundational structures that determine how healthcare services are delivered, financed, and governed. For poor and vulnerable populations, weak health systems represent a major barrier to accessing quality care and financial protection against health shocks. When households face catastrophic health expenditures, they deplete productive assets and fall into poverty traps. Reforms that strengthen health systems can reduce structural inequalities by ensuring that access to quality healthcare is determined by need rather than ability to pay, geographic location, or social status. The distributional impact of these reforms is particularly strong for the poorest quintiles who typically face the highest financial barriers to care and receive the lowest quality services, thereby improving their productive capacity and economic resilience.
 
Policy Area 2.2: Food security and maternal and child nutrition services
Food security and nutrition interventions directly impact human capital formation and economic productivity. Policies that strengthen food security and targeted nutrition services—including maternal supplementation programs, infant and young child feeding initiatives, school feeding programs, and agricultural extension services for smallholder farmers—have strongly progressive distributional effects, as they disproportionately benefit the most vulnerable populations whose productivity is most constrained by nutritional deficits. Early life nutrition interventions yield particularly high economic returns by protecting critical developmental windows during which nutritional deprivation can cause irreversible damage to cognitive and physical capacity. By ensuring adequate nutrition during these sensitive periods, these policies enable poor and vulnerable populations to build and maintain the biological foundations necessary for learning, labor force participation, and economic advancement, breaking intergenerational transmission of poverty through improved health outcomes.
 
Policy Area 2.3: Environmental health determinants and pollution
Environmental health determinants, including water, sanitation, hygiene, and climate-related health risks, significantly impact the health and productivity of vulnerable populations. Poor households are disproportionately exposed to environmental health hazards due to inadequate housing, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and greater exposure to pollution. These environmental inequities contribute to higher disease burdens, increased healthcare costs, and reduced productive capacity. Policies addressing these determinants can represent triple-win opportunities that simultaneously improve health outcomes, reduce poverty, and enhance climate resilience, while helping vulnerable populations build and maintain productive assets. The distributional impact of environmental health interventions is typically progressive, particularly when targeted to underserved communities, as they reduce burdens on vulnerable populations, and create economic opportunities through infrastructure development in low-income areas.
