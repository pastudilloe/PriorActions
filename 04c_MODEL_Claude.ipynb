The economic context reveals a sharp economic contraction in 2008-2009, with GDP falling from over 9% growth to a 3.9% decline, driven by reduced foreign direct investment, exports, and remittances.\"\n",

The grant aims to improve the investment climate, promote exports, protect access to decentralized basic services, and enhance public resource management efficiency. The report highlights Burkina Faso's economic challenges in 2009, including reduced GDP growth to 3.1%, significant cotton sector difficulties, and the impact of global economic downturn and severe flooding. Despite these challenges, the country expects economic recovery, with projected GDP growth of 4.2% in 2010,\"\n",
